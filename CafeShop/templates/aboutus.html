                    <b>   <h2>Our History</h2>  
                <p>SHILOH was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker <br> at Seattle's Pike Place Market. During the early 1980s, they sold the company <br> to Howard Schultz who—after a business trip to Milan, Italy—decided to <br> convert the coffee bean store into a coffee shop serving espresso-based <br> drinks. As chief executive officer from 1986 to 2000, Schultz's first tenure led <br> to an aggressive expansion of the franchise, first in Seattle, then across the <br> West Coast of the United States. Schultz was succeeded by Orin Smith who <br>  ran the company for five years and positioned SHILOH as a large player in <br> fair trade coffee, increasing sales to US $5 billion. Jim Donald served as <br> chief executive officer from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a large-scale <br> earnings expansion. Schultz returned as CEO during the financial crisis of <br> 2007–08 and spent the succeeding decade growing the company's market <br> share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting the brand around corporate <br> social responsibility. Kevin Johnson succeeded Schultz as CEO in 2017. In <br> March 2022, Starbucks announced that Schultz would return as CEO in April <br> 2022 in an interim role. Later that September, Laxman Narasimhan was <br> appointed to succeed him in April 2023, with Schultz remaining a member of <br> the Board of Directors. Narasimhan assumed the position sooner than  <br> planned, in March 2023. <br>
                    In addition to drinks and food, many stores carry SHILOH official <br> merchandise, such as mugs, tumblers, scoops, and  coffee presses. There <br> are also several select "SHILOH Evenings" locations that offer beer, wine, and <br> appetizers. SHILOH-brand coffee, ice cream, and bottled cold coffee drinks <br> are sold at grocery stores in the United States and other countries. In 2010, <br> the company began its SHILOH Reserve program for single-origin coffees <br> and high-end coffee shops. It planned to open 1,000 Reserve coffee shops by <br> the end of 2017. However, since succeeding Schultz, Johnson has scaled <br> back the Reserve coffee shops to only six to ten shops. Further development <br> on Reserve coffee shops will be dependent on the success of the few already <br> in existence. Currently, SHILOH operates six coffee roasteries with tasting <br> rooms and 43 coffee bars as part of the program. The latest roastery <br> location opened on Chicago's Magnificent Mile in November 2019, and is the <br> world's largest SHILOH location. The company has been subject to multiple <br> controversies related to its business practices. Conversely, its franchise <br> has commanded substantial brand loyalty, market share, and company <br> value. The company is ranked 120th on the Fortune 500[8] and 303rd on the <br> Forbes Global 2000, as of 2022.</p>
